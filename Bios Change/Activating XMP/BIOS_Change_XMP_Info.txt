XMP is when you put your RAM speed to the speed they were advertised as. If you don't enable XMP, you are hurting your own performance. 
The thing is, XMP is not overclocking your RAM, either. It is completely safe and everyone recommends using it. 
I put down how to turn on XMP for MSI and Asus motherboards. If you don't have one of those, then just look it up on YouTube.
